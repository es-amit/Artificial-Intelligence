# Artificial-Intelligence
It is a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machine which can behave like a human, think like human and able to take decision on its own.
It is made up of two words- Artificial which means 'man-made' and other Intelligence means 'Thinking power'. 
- We do not need to pre program machine to do some work.
- We have to create a machine with programmed which can work with own intelligence.

## Why AI?
- With the help of AI, we can create such software and devices which can solve real world problems very easily and with accuracy such as health issues, marketing, traffic issues, etc.
- With the help of AI, we can create our own personal virtual assistant such as Google Assistant, Siri, etc.
- We can build such Robots which can work in a enviornment where survival of human can be at risk.
- AI opens a path for new technologies, new devices and new opportunities.

## Goals of AI
1. Replicate Human Intelligence.
2. Solve knowledge intensive skills.
3. An Intelligent connection of persception and action.
4. Building a machine which can perform tasks that requires human intelligence such as:
- providing a theorem
- playing chess
- plan some surgical operation
5. Create some system which can exhibit intelligent behaviour, learn new things by itself, demonstrate, explain and new advise to the user.

## What is Intelligence composed of:
The intelligence is intangible. It is composed of-
- Reasoning
- Learning
- Problem Solving
- Perception
- Linguistic Intelligence

Let us go through all the components briefly-
1. **Reasoning** - It is the set of processes that enables us to provide basis for judgement, making decisionsa and prediction. 
2. **Learning** - It is the activity of gaining knowledge or skill by studying, practising, being taught, or experiencing something. Learning enhances the awareness of the subjects of the study.
3. **Problem Solving** − It is the process in which one perceives and tries to arrive at a desired solution from a present situation by taking some path, which is blocked by known or unknown hurdles.
Problem solving also includes decision making, which is the process of selecting the best suitable alternative out of multiple alternatives to reach the desired goal are available.
4. **Perception** − It is the process of acquiring, interpreting, selecting, and organizing sensory information.
Perception presumes sensing. In humans, perception is aided by sensory organs. In the domain of AI, perception mechanism puts the data acquired by the sensors together in a meaningful manner.
5. **Linguistic Intelligence** − It is one’s ability to use, comprehend, speak, and write the verbal and written language. It is important in interpersonal communication.

## Application of AI

Travel industries are using AI-powered chatbots which can make human-like interaction with customers for better and fast response.
### 8. AI in Robotics:
Artificial Intelligence has a remarkable role in Robotics. Usually, general robots are programmed such that they can perform some repetitive task, but with the help of AI, we can create intelligent robots which can perform tasks with their own experiences without pre-programmed.

### 9. AI in E-Commerce:
AI is providing a competitive edge to the e-commerce industry, and it is becoming more demanding in the e-commerce business. AI is helping shoppers to discover associated products with recommended size, color, or even brand.
### 10. AI in Education:
AI can automate grading so that the tutor can have more time to teach. AI chatbot can communicate with students as a teaching assistant.
AI in the future can be work as a personal virtual tutor for students, which will be accessible easily at any time and any place.


## Agents In AI
The agents sense the envionment through sensors and act ont their enviornment through actuators. AI agents can have mental properties like knowledge, belief and intention, etc.

#### What is an agent?
An agent can be anything that percieve its enviornment through sensors and acts upon that enviornment through actuators.
- **Human agents** has sensory organs such as eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin for sensing, and other organs like hands, legs mouth are actuators.
- **Robotic agents** replaces sense organs by cameras and infrared range for sensing, and other actuators like motors are actuators.
- **Software agents** has encoded bit strings as its programs and actions like keys strokes is a sensor and display unit is an actutator.
---
1. Sensors- It is a device which detects the change in the enviornment and sends the information to other electronic device. An agent observes the enviornment through sensors.
2. Actuators- It is a component of machine that converts energy into motion.
3. Effectors- It is a device which affects the enviornment. It can be legs, wheels, arms, finger and display screen.

**E.g.-** Lets take an example of self driving car which has agent car and enviornment is road and other cars.

## Types of AI agents:
Agents can be grouped into five classes based on their degree of percieved intelligence and capacity.
- Simple reflex agent
- Model based reflex agent
- goal based agent
- Utility based agent
- Learning agent

### 1. Simple reflex agent: 
  - The Simple reflex agents are the simplest agents. These agents take decisions on the basis of the current percepts and ignore the rest of the percept history.
  - These agents only succeed in the fully observable environment.
  - The Simple reflex agent does not consider any part of percepts history during their decision and action process.
  - The Simple reflex agent works on Condition-action rule, which means it maps the current state to action. Such as a Room Cleaner agent, it works only if there is dirt in the room.

### \# Problems for the simple reflex agent design approach:
  - They have very limited intelligence
  - They do not have knowledge of non-perceptual parts of the current state
  - Mostly too big to generate and to store.
  - Not adaptive to changes in the environment.

### 2. Model based reflex agents: 
  - The Model-based agent can work in a partially observable environment, and track the situation.
  - A model-based agent has two important factors:
    - Model: It is knowledge about "how things happen in the world," so it is called a Model-based agent.
    - Internal State: It is a representation of the current state based on percept history.
  - These agents have the model, "which is knowledge of the world" and based on the model they perform actions

### 3. Goal based agents: 
  - The knowledge of the current state environment is not always sufficient to decide for an agent to what to do
  - The agent needs to know its goal which describes desirable situations.
  - Goal-based agents expand the capabilities of the model-based agent by having the "goal" information.
  - They choose an action, so that they can achieve the goal.

### 4. Utility based agents: 
  - The knowledge of the current state environment is not always sufficient to decide for an agent to what to doThese agents are similar to the goal-based agent but provide an extra component of utility measurement which makes them different by providing a measure of success at a given state.
  - Utility-based agent act based not only goals but also the best way to achieve the goal.
  - The Utility-based agent is useful when there are multiple possible alternatives, and an agent has to choose in order to perform the best action.
  - The utility function maps each state to a real number to check how efficiently each action achieves the goals.

### 5. Learning agents: 
  - A learning agent in AI is the type of agent which can learn from its past experiences, or it has learning capabilities
  - It starts to act with basic knowledge and then able to act and adapt automatically through learning.
  - A learning agent has mainly four conceptual components, which are:
      - Learning element: It is responsible for making improvements by learning from environment
      - Critic: Learning element takes feedback from critic which describes that how well the agent is doing with respect to a            fixed performance standard.
      - Performance element: It is responsible for selecting external action
      - Problem generator: This component is responsible for suggesting actions that will lead to new and informative                   experiences.
  - Hence, learning agents are able to learn, analyze performance, and look for new ways to improve the performance.
