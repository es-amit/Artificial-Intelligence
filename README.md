# Artificial-Intelligence
It is a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machine which can behave like a human, think like human and able to take decision on its own.
It is made up of two words- Artificial which means 'man-made' and other Intelligence means 'Thinking power'. 
- We do not need to pre program machine to do some work.
- We have to create a machine with programmed which can work with own intelligence.

## Why AI?
- With the help of AI, we can create such software and devices which can solve real world problems very easily and with accuracy such as health issues, marketing, traffic issues, etc.
- With the help of AI, we can create our own personal virtual assistant such as Google Assistant, Siri, etc.
- We can build such Robots which can work in a enviornment where survival of human can be at risk.
- AI opens a path for new technologies, new devices and new opportunities.

## Goals of AI
1. Replicate Human Intelligence.
2. Solve knowledge intensive skills.
3. An Intelligent connection of persception and action.
4. Building a machine which can perform tasks that requires human intelligence such as:
- providing a theorem
- playing chess
- plan some surgical operation
5. Create some system which can exhibit intelligent behaviour, learn new things by itself, demonstrate, explain and new advise to the user.

## What is Intelligence composed of:
The intelligence is intangible. It is composed of-
- Reasoning
- Learning
- Problem Solving
- Perception
- Linguistic Intelligence

Let us go through all the components briefly-
1. **Reasoning** - It is the set of processes that enables us to provide basis for judgement, making decisionsa and prediction. 
2. **Learning** - It is the activity of gaining knowledge or skill by studying, practising, being taught, or experiencing something. Learning enhances the awareness of the subjects of the study.
3. **Problem Solving** − It is the process in which one perceives and tries to arrive at a desired solution from a present situation by taking some path, which is blocked by known or unknown hurdles.
Problem solving also includes decision making, which is the process of selecting the best suitable alternative out of multiple alternatives to reach the desired goal are available.
4. **Perception** − It is the process of acquiring, interpreting, selecting, and organizing sensory information.
Perception presumes sensing. In humans, perception is aided by sensory organs. In the domain of AI, perception mechanism puts the data acquired by the sensors together in a meaningful manner.
5. **Linguistic Intelligence** − It is one’s ability to use, comprehend, speak, and write the verbal and written language. It is important in interpersonal communication.
