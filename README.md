# Artificial-Intelligence
It is a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machine which can behave like a human, think like human and able to take decision on its own.
It is made up of two words- Artificial which means 'man-made' and other Intelligence means 'Thinking power'. 
- We do not need to pre program machine to do some work.
- We have to create a machine with programmed which can work with own intelligence.

## Why AI?
- With the help of AI, we can create such software and devices which can solve real world problems very easily and with accuracy such as health issues, marketing, traffic issues, etc.
- With the help of AI, we can create our own personal virtual assistant such as Google Assistant, Siri, etc.
- We can build such Robots which can work in a enviornment where survival of human can be at risk.
- AI opens a path for new technologies, new devices and new opportunities.

## Goals of AI
1. Replicate Human Intelligence.
2. Solve knowledge intensive skills.
3. An Intelligent connection of persception and action.
4. Building a machine which can perform tasks that requires human intelligence such as:
- providing a theorem
- playing chess
- plan some surgical operation
5. Create some system which can exhibit intelligent behaviour, learn new things by itself, demonstrate, explain and new advise to the user.

## What is Intelligence composed of:
The intelligence is intangible. It is composed of-
- Reasoning
- Learning
- Problem Solving
- Perception
- Linguistic Intelligence

Let us go through all the components briefly-
1. **Reasoning** - It is the set of processes that enables us to provide basis for judgement, making decisionsa and prediction. 
2. **Learning** - It is the activity of gaining knowledge or skill by studying, practising, being taught, or experiencing something. Learning enhances the awareness of the subjects of the study.
3. **Problem Solving** − It is the process in which one perceives and tries to arrive at a desired solution from a present situation by taking some path, which is blocked by known or unknown hurdles.
Problem solving also includes decision making, which is the process of selecting the best suitable alternative out of multiple alternatives to reach the desired goal are available.
4. **Perception** − It is the process of acquiring, interpreting, selecting, and organizing sensory information.
Perception presumes sensing. In humans, perception is aided by sensory organs. In the domain of AI, perception mechanism puts the data acquired by the sensors together in a meaningful manner.
5. **Linguistic Intelligence** − It is one’s ability to use, comprehend, speak, and write the verbal and written language. It is important in interpersonal communication.

## Application of AI
### 1.   AI in Astronomy:
Artificial Intelligence can be very useful to solve complex universe problems. AI technology can be helpful for understanding the universe such as how it works, origin, etc.

### 2.  AI in healthcare:
Healthcare Industries are applying AI to make a better and faster diagnosis than humans. AI can help doctors with diagnoses and can inform when patients are worsening so that medical help can reach to the patient before hospitalization.

### 3. AI in Gaming:
AI can be used for gaming purpose. The AI machine can play strategic games like chess, where the machine needs to think of a large number of possible places.

### 4. AI in Finance:
AI and finance industries are the best matches for each other. The finance industry is implementing automation, chatbot, adaptive intelligence, algorithm trading, and machine learning into financial processes.

### 5. AI in Data Security:
The security of data is crucial for every company and cyber-attacks are growing very rapidly in the digital world. AI can be used to make your data more safe and secure. Some examples such as AEG bot, AI2 Platform,are used to determine software bug and cyber-attacks in a better way.

### 6. AI in Social Media:
Social Media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat contain billions of user profiles, which need to be stored and managed in a very efficient way. AI can organize and manage massive amounts of data. AI can analyze lots of data to identify the latest trends, hashtag, and requirement of different users.

### 7. AI in Travel and Transport:
AI is becoming highly demanding for travel industries. AI is capable of doing various travel related works such as from making travel arrangement to suggesting the hotels, flights, and best routes to the customers. Travel industries are using AI-powered chatbots which can make human-like interaction with customers for better and fast response.
### 8. AI in Robotics:
Artificial Intelligence has a remarkable role in Robotics. Usually, general robots are programmed such that they can perform some repetitive task, but with the help of AI, we can create intelligent robots which can perform tasks with their own experiences without pre-programmed.

### 9. AI in E-Commerce:
AI is providing a competitive edge to the e-commerce industry, and it is becoming more demanding in the e-commerce business. AI is helping shoppers to discover associated products with recommended size, color, or even brand.
### 10. AI in Education:
AI can automate grading so that the tutor can have more time to teach. AI chatbot can communicate with students as a teaching assistant.
AI in the future can be work as a personal virtual tutor for students, which will be accessible easily at any time and any place.


## Agents In AI
The agents sense the envionment through sensors and act ont their enviornment through actuators. AI agents can have mental properties like knowledge, belief and intention, etc.

#### What is an agent?
An agent can be anything that percieve its enviornment through sensors and acts upon that enviornment through actuators.
- **Human agents** has sensory organs such as eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin for sensing, and other organs like hands, legs mouth are actuators.
- **Robotic agents** replaces sense organs by cameras and infrared range for sensing, and other actuators like motors are actuators.
- **Software agents** has encoded bit strings as its programs and actions like keys strokes is a sensor and display unit is an actutator.
